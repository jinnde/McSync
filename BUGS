# MCSYNCS' KNOWN BUGS

The following are known bugs which I have not had the time to track down properly:

- Sometimes there is problem with hasing an invalid fileinfo->filename usually related to git files.
  possible reasons include: very short file names, space in the filepath.

- Segmentation fault after deleting a graft and saving when trying to display the files.

- The scans are inserted at the wrong place when scanning a subfolder of grafts.

  This problem is related to the handling of the history or the lack thereof. Currently the workers
  just send in the whole tree of their fileinfo history tree and of course, this does not match the
  currently scanned folder in all cases which leads to shifted inserts.

  -> We need to think about how to store, load and transfer history to and from hq and workers.
